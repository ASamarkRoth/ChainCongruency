# Chain Congruency

The congruency within and between sets of decay chains of superheavy nuclei are evaluated on the basis of a statistical method developed by Ulrika Forsberg ([PhD Thesis, "Element 115"](http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/7495513/thesis.pdf)).

## To do

* Use pandas dataframe for representation of chain data and export to markdown \& latex tables. 
* Write compiled data set in dataframe to pickle file.
* Use dataframe in order to extract interesting data. 
* Perform simulations, initially on the side, i.e. not pandas integrated. 
* Present data from dataframes and include ipywidgets in order to choose data set to plot. 
* Write analytical derivation with sympy.
