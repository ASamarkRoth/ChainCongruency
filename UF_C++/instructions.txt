Directory Probability_calculations contains the programs for calculations the FoM (and generalised Schmidt method). You define and select in "scenario_time_and_number" if you want to calculate it for the real chains or simulated chains. The program does slighy diffferent things depenging on this chose - it either calcuates the values for the real data set, or it calculates the calues for the simulated data sets and gives you the confidence intervals.

Run it by opening root and typing 
>.L ProbXXX.cxx 
>main()


There real chains are in the folders "E117_chains" and "E115_chains". 

The README in E115_chains has some info about some chains that I have re-interpreted (according to discussions with Dirk about previous (small) misinterpretations from Dubna.)

The names are explained in the file "Numbering_of_chains" in E115_chains.

Also the simulated chains (on how to simulate them, see later in this text) are foudn in the folder "E115_chains/simulated_chains". Here I've put all simulated chains, regardless of them being E115 or E117 or E117... 

There are three folders for different types of simulations. The one I ended up using most in the end is "taus_from_tau_likelihood" (option nr 1 in the code). In this folder, you also find scripts that you can run to put in zeroes in certain places in the simulated data files if you need. Runt he script files by typing

>./scriptXXX.sh

Notice that I've made the programs such that when you simulated chains, you must have created the folder with the right name inside the "taus_from_tau_likelihood" before you run the simulation program, otherwise the simulated files are not stored...

Now to the simulation programs:

Go to the folder "random_chain_generators" and run the program "random_chain_geerators.cxx" in root. There are lots of things to change inside the program, e.g. which folder to write to. 


FIRST test case:

I've gone through a very first test case, in which I simulated 10000 chains. When I simulated chains I use the options (1, 100, 9) (method, number of sets, number of chains) when running the random_chain_generator.cxx in root. This puts simulated chains in the folder E115/simulated_chains/taus_from_tau_likelihood/test_sim_chains.

Then, I run the script that is in the folder, which puts zeroes in some places where data is missing. It's poorly programmed, so it will always try to access one last set of chains that is not there.

In scenario_time_and_number.cxx the corresponding experimental data is scenario = 10. For calculations on the 10000 simulated chains, the scenario is 13.  

For exp data I get: 

The fantastic FoM is 0.247103
The great generalised Schmidt value is 0.927885

For simulated data I get:

Upper 3-sigma limit is 0.28100
Upper 1% limit is 0.26900
Upper 2-sigma limit is 0.26100
 Upper 5% limit is 0.25300
 Upper 1-sigma limit is 0.23600
Average value is 0.20541
Lower 1-sigma limit is 0.17600
Lower 5% limit is 0.15600
Lower 2-sigma limit is 0.14700
Lower 1% limit is 0.13700
Lower 3-sigma limit is 0.11800

which indicates that the experimental data is within the 90% (double-sided) interal.
