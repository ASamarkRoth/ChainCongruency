# Presentation notes

Structure of presentation: 

1. Introduce you to the background of the creation of this notebook and the topic. 
2. Thoughts I carried with me in the implementation simultaneously as walking through the example. 

## Intro

* Who am I and what am I working.
* As a physicist, believe it or not, involved in chemistry. 
* Discovery of new elements accepted 1 year ago.
* Properties of chains: lifetimes.
* Same observations of starting from E117 and E115.
* Well known exponential behaviour, exploited in a thorough statistical assessment. 

## Example

* Large focus implementing pandas data frame due to the nice presentation opportunity. 
* Pedagogical: 
	* try all cells to have a descriptive output (table/figure)
	* not too much focus on performance (not really needed) 
	* avoid functions because bad readability for jumping around in the notebook.  
* 





Problems met: 

* Changing matplotlib parameters first in the document. However, when running the complete notebook these are not "activated" and the default jump in. 
* Figure captions.
* Tried to add Author in the metadata without success. 
* Scroll in slide view.
